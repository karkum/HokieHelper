The app has been updated to use ActionBarSherlock as a way to implement 
the ICS design guidelines and use native Android 4.x ActionBar code in projects, 
while still maintaining a consistent look and feel across devices running 
Android 2.x and 3.x.  To get this project to work in eclipse, you're going to 
have to download the ActionBarSherlock library located at:
