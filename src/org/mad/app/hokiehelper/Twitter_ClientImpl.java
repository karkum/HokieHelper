	 * Returns tweets that match a specified query.
	 * 
	 * @param query
	 *            Search query. Should be URL encoded. Queries will be limited
	 *            by complexity Example Values: "@noradio"
	 * 
	 * @param geo
	 *            Returns tweets by users located within a given radius of the
	 *            given latitude/longitude. The location is preferentially
	 *            taking from the Geotagging API, but will fall back to their
	 *            Twitter profile. The parameter value is specified by
	 *            "latitude,longitude,radius", where radius units must be
	 *            specified as either "mi" (miles) or "km" (kilometers). Note
	 *            that you cannot use the near operator via the API to geocode
	 *            arbitrary locations; however you can use this geocode
	 *            parameter to search near geocodes directly. Example Values:
	 *            37.781157,-122.398720,1mi
	 * 
	 * @param result_type
	 *            Optional. Specifies what type of search results you would
	 *            prefer to receive. The current default is "mixed." Valid
	 *            values include: mixed: Include both popular and real time
	 *            results in the response. recent: return only the most recent
	 *            results in the response popular: return only the most popular
	 *            results in the response. Example Values: mixed, recent,
	 *            popular
	 * 
	 * @param include_entities
	 *            When set to either true, t or 1, each tweet will include a
	 *            node called "entities,". This node offers a variety of
	 *            metadata about the tweet in a discreet structure, including:
	 *            urls, media and hashtags. Note that user mentions are
	 *            currently not supported for search and there will be no
	 *            "user_mentions" key in the entities map. See Tweet Entities
	 *            for more detail on entities. Please note that entities are

	/**
	 * Returns the 20 most recent statuses posted by the authenticating user. It
	 * is also possible to request another user's timeline by using the
	 * screen_name or user_id parameter. The other users timeline will only be
	 * visible if they are not protected, or if the authenticating user's follow
	 * request was accepted by the protected user.
	 * 
	 * The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view a
	 * user's profile on twitter.com.
	 * 
	 * This method can only return up to 3,200 of a user's most recent statuses.
	 * Native retweets of other statuses by the user is included in this total,
	 * regardless of whether include_rts is specified when requesting this
	 * resource.
	 * 
	 * This method will not include retweets in the XML and JSON responses
	 * unless the include_rts parameter is set. The RSS and Atom responses will
	 * always include retweets as statuses prefixed with RT.
	 * 
	 * @param user_id
	 *            The ID of the user for whom to return results for. Helpful for
	 *            disambiguating when a valid user ID is also a valid screen
	 *            name. Example Values: 12345 Note:: Specifies the ID of the
	 *            user to befriend. Helpful for disambiguating when a valid user
	 *            ID is also a valid screen name.
	 * 
	 * @param screen_name
	 *            The screen name of the user for whom to return results for.
	 *            Helpful for disambiguating when a valid screen name is also a
	 *            user ID. Example Values: noradio
	 * 
	 * @param count
	 *            Specifies the number of tweets to try and retrieve, up to a
	 *            maximum of 200. The value of count is best thought of as a
	 *            limit to the number of tweets to return because suspended or
	 *            deleted content is removed after the count has been applied.
	 *            We include retweets in the count, even if include_rts is not
	 *            supplied. It is recommended you always send include_rts=1 when
	 *            using this API method.
	 * 
	 * @param include_rts
	 *            When set to either true, t or 1,the timeline will contain
	 *            native retweets (if they exist) in addition to the standard
	 *            stream of tweets. The output format of retweeted tweets is
	 *            identical to the representation you see in home_timeline.
	 *            Note: If you're using the trim_user parameter in conjunction
	 *            with include_rts, the retweets will still contain a full user
	 *            object. Example Values: true
	 * 
	 * @param include_entities
	 *            When set to either true, t or 1, each tweet will include a
	 *            node called "entities,". This node offers a variety of
	 *            metadata about the tweet in a discreet structure, including:
	 *            user_mentions, urls, and hashtags. While entities are opt-in
	 *            on timelines at present, they will be made a default component
	 *            of output in the future. See Tweet Entities for more detail on
	 *            entities. Example Values: true
	 * 
	 * @param exclude_replies
	 *            This parameter will prevent replies from appearing in the
	 *            returned timeline. Using exclude_replies with the count
	 *            parameter will mean you will receive up-to count tweets â€” this
	 *            is because the count parameter retrieves that many tweets
	 *            before filtering out retweets and replies. Example Values:
